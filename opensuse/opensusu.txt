Summary        : Basic Clients and Utilities for PostgreSQL
Description    :
    PostgreSQL is an advanced object-relational database management system
    that supports an extended subset of the SQL standard, including
    transactions, foreign keys, subqueries, triggers, and user-defined
    types and functions.

    This package contains the basic utility and client programs necessary
    to maintain and work with local or remote PostgreSQL databases as well
    as manual pages for the SQL commands that PostgreSQL supports. Full
    HTML documentation for PostgreSQL can be found in the postgresql-docs
    package.
